# FILE DEPTH CONFIGURATION

# How deep to traverse directories when analyzing code
# - 0 = root directory only (no subdirectories)

# Directory names/patterns to exclude from traversal
# These are sensible defaults for Python/JS projects and can be overridden
# Default exclusions include: .venv, venv, node_modules, dist, build,
# __pycache__, .pytest_cache, .git, and other common cache/build directories
# dirs = []  # Uncomment to override defaults with custom list

Focus on the module's responsibilities and design patterns.
Explain what problems this module solves.
Keep it practical and search-optimized for grep/code navigation.
